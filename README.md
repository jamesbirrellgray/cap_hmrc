# CAP GEMINI HRMC TEST
Test Started at 07:55 04/07/2017

* Unsure as to if the govuk/HMRC libraries can be used such as the https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template, https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit and https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements libraries
* For this kind of work there is also the https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit library
* For the sake of this test I have utilised the "assets" from the govuk template lbrary (HTML output) and the initial index.html
* To ensure that the markup is semantic and accesable I will use the existing patterns available in the govuk_elements library (https://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/) and https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend library

## Starting a test server
* Make sure you have python installed
* Using terminal go to the directory where this readme is and enter the following command `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
* The exmaple will be available on your localhost on port 8000 (http://localhost:8000)
